This app uses MySQL and its SQL file is in the SQL folder. The db.php file in the includes folder should include the required database settings. The admin credentials is username: admin and password: 1234 where the admin page is url/admin. **Security risk:** The password can be changed in the SQL file as it has not been hashed in this practice project so, please encrypt the password if using this project.
